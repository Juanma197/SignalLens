## Current milestone

Milestone 5 — broader evidence: complete and ready to merge.

## Delivered

### Existing research foundation

- Fixed 30-stock universe with reproducible adjusted daily price history in DuckDB.
- Leakage-safe point-in-time features, 21-trading-day outcomes, and walk-forward evaluation.
- Immutable prediction vintages, latest ranking API, outcome tracking, archive, and personal watchlist.
- Live ranking remains the deterministic 126-trading-day momentum benchmark.
- The benchmark is historically encouraging research evidence, not validated alpha or investment advice.

### SEC filings and fundamentals

- SEC EDGAR filing ingestion with descriptive user-agent support, provenance, timestamps, deduplication, and per-ticker failure records.
- SEC Company Facts ingestion for revenue, net income, diluted EPS, assets, liabilities, and cash.
- Point-in-time fundamental queries enforce both availability and retrieval boundaries.
- Complete, partial, and missing coverage states are exposed through the API and dashboard.
- Full-universe local ingestion completed without failed tickers.
- Repeated ingestion is idempotent.

### Macro context

- FRED ingestion for the federal funds rate, CPI, unemployment, and 10-year Treasury yield.
- Retry and timeout handling for intermittent public-source failures.
- Point-in-time macro API with observation dates, retrieval dates, units, freshness, and missing/stale states.
- The current local snapshot contains all four expected series.

### Public news evidence

- Google News RSS ingestion supplies lawful public headline metadata and publisher attribution.
- Optional GDELT support remains available, with rate-limit failures recorded rather than hidden.
- Full-universe Google News ingestion completed with no failed tickers.
- News storage is content-addressed and idempotent.

### Immutable research snapshots

Every newly published ranking vintage freezes:

- The price-based ranking and strategy provenance.
- Macro observations available at publication.
- Latest SEC fundamental facts available at publication.
- Up to three SEC filings and three news items per selected ticker.
- Source URLs, publication dates, retrieval dates, freshness states, missing coverage, and provider errors.

Older vintages are never rewritten. New evidence cannot silently alter the historical explanation shown for an earlier ranking.

### Dashboard

- Current macro environment panel with source links and freshness.
- Top-three momentum cards with frozen macro, fundamentals, filings, and news.
- Explicit labels distinguish frozen context from the price signal.
- Predicted-versus-actual tracking, watchlist notes, and immutable vintage history remain available.
- Honest unavailable, partial, missing, stale, failed, and pending states are displayed.

## Verification

- 77 backend tests pass on Windows with Python 3.13.
- Frontend ESLint passes.
- The optimized Next.js production build completes successfully.
- The only backend warning is a third-party Starlette/AnyIO deprecation warning.
- Latest ranking vintage `3328ecc7-3b88-4d87-a5c5-a6b500e35304` was published with frozen macro, fundamental, filing, and news context.
- The working tree was clean after restoring the generated `frontend/next-env.d.ts` change.

## Known limitations

- The universe is fixed, so historical results remain exposed to survivorship and selection bias.
- Yahoo Finance and public RSS feeds are research-grade sources, not production market-data guarantees.
- The reported momentum result has no untouched holdout or completed live forward window.
- Fundamentals, filings, news, and macro data are research context only; they do not yet alter the ranking score.
- Fundamental comparison across sectors requires normalization before it can be used responsibly in a model.
- News metadata is not a validated sentiment signal.
- Publication and ingestion remain manual local commands.
- The application has no authentication, managed deployment, scheduled jobs, monitoring, or remote backups.
- Watchlist mutations are intended only for local/private use.

## Next action

1. Run the full verification script and inspect the refreshed dashboard.
2. Merge `feature/milestone-5-broader-evidence` into `main`.
3. Begin Milestone 6 — private deployment, authentication, CI, secrets, scheduling, monitoring, and backups.
